This file describes how test cells were selected.

FourDoorDirections:
    The cells chosen ensure that one doorway with each direction is tested as well as one walkway and one room cell that are not doorways.

TestNumberOfDoorways:
    Every cell is checked to ensure that the total number of doorways is calculated before comparing with the expected value.
    Since the number of doorways might be changed if we were to redesign the board, the number of total doorways is stored in a static variable and used as the expected variable.

TestRooms:
    We chose different cells with different attributes to test all outcomes.
    We chose one cell that is in a room, but is not a doorway, does not have a label, and is not the center of the room and is not a secret passage.
